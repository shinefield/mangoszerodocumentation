Roadmap
*******

The `database`_
is developed following a well defined roadmap. Here you will be able to
find out what we are working on, and what is coming up next. Please note
that the roadmap is only listed detailed for the current month, changes
planned for later dates are just listed with their topics, excluding any
further details.

Introduction
------------

Developing a content database from scratch is not an easy task, and thus
we do rely on a pre-defined roadmap to build and release content for our
project.

At first glance, game content for **vanilla WoW** may look small when
compared to the expansions. But as soon as you look below the surface,
that theory does not hold up. `Vanilla WoW`_ did not only consist of
creatures, quests, items and holiday events, it also had many events
related to quests, random world events; there have been groups for
creatures and objects and many more features to consider.

Finally, we decided to follow the same process which `Blizzard Entertainment`_
followed during the `World of Warcraft beta`_: we will develop and release
content **based on level range**.

Rationale
---------

Developing and releasing content based on level ranges comes with a few
benefits and solves a few issues we had when we initially considered
rebuilding the database from scratch:

-  developing based on level ranges is better than building by zones:
   instead of having content available for specific zones and thus
   selected races in the early stages, a level based development process
   will result in having content for both factions at the same time.
-  it will lead to developing the dungeon content, and content such as
   world events level based, too. This means our future users and
   testers can enjoy the full range of content instead of partial
   content.

A :ref:`list of region levels <db-contributing-region-levels>` is available.

Milestones
----------

The following table shows which level ranges we consider canonical for
each of our release milestones.
