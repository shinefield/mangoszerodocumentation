The Roadmap
***********

As **mangos-zero** is under heavy development, this document intends to provide an
overview of the road ahead.

We are working hard on the architecture and the most basic features required to run
a successful `World of Warcraft`_ server. This phase will involve several Backwards
Compatibility breaks, but we will do our best to provide upgrade instructions for
the brave Early Adopters.

Version 1.0.0
-------------

-  Build system rewrite, for better cross platform build support, initially
   targeting Linux, Windows, Mac OS x and FreeBSD.
-  Documentation! You are reading it right now. For the first time ever since the
   founding of the MaNGOS project, we will provide documentation for all aspects
   of the software.

Version 1.1.0
-------------

-  Hot on the heels we will work hard to improve game features, refactor where
   needed and clean up existing code.
-  Documentation will be expanded, including development information, such as reverse
   engineered information of client file formats, or the client/server communication
   protocol.
