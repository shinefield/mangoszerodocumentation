Contributing to the Documentation
=================================

Documentation is as important as code. It follows the exact same principles:
DRY, tests, ease of maintenance, extensibility, optimization, and refactoring
just to name a few. And of course, documentation has bugs, typos, hard to read
tutorials, and more.
