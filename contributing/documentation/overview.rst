Contributing to the Documentation
=================================

Documentation is as important as code. It follows the exact same principles:
DRY, tests, ease of maintenance, extensibility, optimization, and refactoring
just to name a few. And of course, documentation has bugs, typos, hard to read
tutorials, and more.

.. tip::

    If this is your first time thinking about writing documentation, have a look
    at `Writing great documentation`_ from Jacob Kaplan-Moss, one of the authors
    of Django, an awesome Python web framework.
