==================
Linux Installation
==================

**mangos-zero** supports Linux by default, as it is our development platform of
choice. Currently development is done on `Debian 7`_, `Ubuntu 12.04`_ and
`Ubuntu 14.04`_. If you use a different Linux brand, you may have to use other
names for packages and will - of course - have to use a different package
manager.
